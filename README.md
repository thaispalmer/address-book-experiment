Address Book Experiment
=======================

On this experiment, it will be made an online Address Book from scratch using various frameworks and languages, for expanding knowledge and being able to do a fair comparison between each test subject, since the same thing will be created for every test subject with the same conditions.


## Conditions

  - Backend must be a REST API
  - Frontend will use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), with the same layout for the views in all tests, regardless of the template engine


## Points to be observed/noticed

  - Documentation
  - Easy to use
  - Time spent on stories
  - Number of files on start versus finish
  - Amount of code typed
  - Legibility
  - Testing


## Project definitions
